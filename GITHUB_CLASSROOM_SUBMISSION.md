### Before You Start

- Complete your work in the provided Jupyter notebook

### Easy Submission Process (Using VS Code Interface)

#### 1. Complete Your Assignment

- Complete all code cells and markdown responses
- **Run all cells** to show outputs (Cell â†’ Run All)
- **Save your notebook** (Ctrl+S or File â†’ Save)

#### 2. Submit Using VS Code (No Command Line Required!)

**Step 2a: Open Source Control**
- Look at the left sidebar in VS Code
- Click the **Source Control** icon (looks like a branching tree) 
- You'll see a list of files you've changed

**Step 2b: Stage Your Changes**
- You should see `homework_lesson_1.ipynb` in the list
- Click the **"+"** button next to your notebook file
- This "stages" your file for submission

**Step 2c: Add a Message**
- In the text box at the top, type a message like:
  `Submit homework 1 - [Your Name]`

**Step 2d: Commit (Save Your Changes)**
- Click the **"Commit"** button
- This saves your changes locally

**Step 2e: Push (Submit to GitHub Classroom)**
- Click **"Sync Changes"** or **"Push"** button
- This submits your assignment to GitHub Classroom!

#### 3. Verify Your Submission
1. **Look for success message** in VS Code - you should see "Successfully pushed" or similar
2. **Visit your GitHub repository**:
   - Open a new browser tab
   - Go to your assignment repository (the URL should be in your browser history)
   - Navigate to `assignment/Homework/`
   - Click on your notebook file
   - **Confirm you can see your completed work with all outputs**

### âœ… You Know It Worked When:

- Your notebook appears on GitHub with your completed work
- You can see all your code outputs in the online version
- The file shows a recent "Last commit" time

### ðŸš¨ What If Something Goes Wrong?

**"No changes detected":**
- Make sure you saved your notebook first (Ctrl+S)
- Check that you actually made changes to the file

**"Sync failed" or error messages:**
- Try clicking "Pull" first, then "Push" again
- If still having issues, contact your instructor

**Can't find Source Control:**

- If you don't see it, go to View â†’ Source Control

**Don't see your file in the changes list:**
- Make sure you saved the file (Ctrl+S)
- Try refreshing VS Code (F5)
